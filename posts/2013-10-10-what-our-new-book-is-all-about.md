At first, we thought that our <%= landing_link("new book") %> is all about remote
work. But then after writing few chapters we saw that it is not. That those
techniques can be applied to any team. So what is it all about?

## Working in a nicely organized project.

And happiness. Exactly this kind of happiness related to working in a nicely organized project. Because
even if we develop applications in our favorite programming language (Ruby
anyone?) we can still be in a lot of stress due to the way the project is
managed, right?

Are developers feeling unhappy in your current project? Is it draining energy
from them? Maybe the whole team is trapped in micro-management and does not
know a way of escape from it. Perhaps peoples skills stuck on certain level and
everybody is working on the same, fenced parts of the code over and over,
leading to an isolation. Possible you are all working from the office, when
sometimes you just want need to be alone to focus fully. And even when you
deliver new features you still feel like nothing is actually finished-finished.
But does it have to be like that? **Is your project easy to manage for the managers,
to work with for the programmers and to follow by the customer?**

What if programmers working on a project could be more happy? Feel trusted and
**enjoy tremendous freedom**. What if they could experience progress in their
skills, learn and master new technologies without having to do it only in
their free time? Could the team be like a small community, supportive and
interested in each other problems? What can help making such team?

What if you could improve many areas of your current project management
that has a direct effect on you and your team happiness.
Like immedietaly knowing **what you should be working on** when you start your day.
Delivering something valuable even twice a day and **being proud** of that.
Being able to organize your time according to your liking and **priorities**?
Take your time in the middle of the day to create a meal compatible with
your diet, exercise, walk  or take a lovely nap to refresh your mind.
What if tasks in unfamiliar technology are **learning opportunities** and
small challenges and instead of being scary monsters? Can you imagine
your team **collaborating together** on the whole code?

Our ebook is for you if you value **Independence, Clarity, Focus, Freedom and Collaboration**.
It contains a list of guidelines that we established at Arkency throughout _years
of working remotely_. You can apply them to your project _slowly_ and every
one of them will help you improve some of the aspects. Together they make
a tremendous difference and let you enjoy lot of the benefits that a
programmer job can offer. They create a programmer friendly environment in
which you can feel comfortable and productive. After all, most of your team
consist of programmers, so the project should be optimized for their
efficiency and happiness. But it also creates a nice set of rules that make the customers
and product owners communication with developers easier.

As programmers we are privileged. In our lives we can enjoy many things that
people doing other kinds of job cannot. But we need a work-flow that will let
us actually seize the opportunities such as eg. the ability to work remotely.

As team leaders and company owners we always want to hire and work with
the best people. But they also have very high expectations. Is your company
ready to provide them a nicely working experience to benefit most from their
talent and experience? We are also always overloaded with tons of other duties
and activities so we would like the dev team to **take care of itself as much as possible**.
It would be best if they could self-organize the work, find priorities and assign
tasks. But do we let them? Do we know how? Don't worry, we will show you
how.

When we started writing the book, we promised that we will help your team
transition into **remote working** and
we will still do that. Because the crucial ingredient for successful remote
working is **project organization and excellent communication**. And we intend to
write about that. But you can still benefit greatly by following the advices from
the book even if remote working is not your highest priority right now.
