# How to find records where column is not null or empty in Rails 4 or 5

We all know that especially in legacy applications sometimes our database columns are not that well maintained. So we need to query for, or exclude rows containing `nil`/`NULL` and empty strings (`""`) as well. How can we do it in ActiveRecord?

<!-- more -->

Let's say your Active Record model is called `User` and the DB column we are going to be searching by is `category`.

## find records where column is null or empty

That's simple.

```ruby
User.where(category: [nil, ""])
```

## find records where column is not null or empty

Still easy.

```ruby
User.where.not(category: "")
```

This `not()` clause is going to only apply to one `where`. You are not going to negate all previous conditions. In other words you can safely use it like this:

```ruby
User.
  where(state: "active").
  where.not(category: [nil, ""]).
  where("created_at > ?", 5.days.ago)
```

to get SQL statement like this:

```sql
SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
WHERE
  "users"."state" = "active" AND
  (NOT (("users"."category" = '' OR "users"."category" IS NULL))) AND
  (created_at > '2017-09-01 14:27:11')
```
