# Developers oriented project management

Working remotely is still a relatively new thing compared to going to an office,
which has centuries long tradition. Despite its tremendous growth recently
(especially in IT industry), there is not a lot of literature about best
practices and working solutions. We still miss patterns for remote
collaboration.

**Many companies try remote working, but fail at doing it
effectively.**

They go with the conclusion that it is a broken model. But the truth
is, that working remotely is just different, and expecting it to be the same as
stationary work, with just people in different places, is the biggest mistake
that one can made about it. To fully benefit from it, one must learn how to get
most out of it. 

**You need to learn how to embrace remote work, instead of working around it.**

On the other hand,
some companies are already there, when it comes to remote working. Or at least
they think they are. But is there something more that we can strive for? More
ideas that we can try and benefit from? Many of them.

As programmers and managers we are in constant search for techniques that can
improve our effectiveness. We want to deliver software faster and of better
quality. And when projects succeed we need to scale developers team with the
growth of the business. Imagine that you can add team members without much worrying
of additional communication costs. Imagine your team reaching its full potential
instead of mediocre.

That's why we are writing a book, to help you. It will teach you how certain practices can empower
people working in your organization. How to avoid wasting time and resources on
repetitive ceremonies that bring little value. And how to communicate so that nobody
needs to hear you, yet everybody can listen you. 

However, it is not a book for project
managers or business owners only. The advices here are also intended for
programmers. Because as we all know, the change can be as well introduced bottom-up.
And with this pack of knowledge, programmers can become great managers. So if
you ever felt undervalued as developer and wondered how a different environment,
which gives you more responsibility, might look like, go and read it.

## What can you expect

The first chapter focuses on topic of story size. Specifically why using
stories of size 1 helps you deliver and gives team members
a [closure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28psychology%29). And how it
also allows you to manage priorities on daily basis and avoid risk.

The second chapter, that is currently being written by Andrzej Krzywda, is about
overcommunication. That is the essence of our communication. How a little too much
is always better than a little not enough. What things are worth communicating
and which new tools and techniques can help you deliver your message more
clearly.

Another topics that we hope to cover:

* Continuous deployment,
* Lack of Pull Requests,
* Green Build
* Screencasts
* Developers talking to clients and creating tickets
* Lack of Project Managers
* Sprints
* Automation
* Standups and Meetings
* Splitting tickets across developers
* Estimations
* And probably even more
